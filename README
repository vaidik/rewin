This is a Python script that lets you resize active GNOME windows with
the help of keyboard shortcuts. Rewin lets users resize windows to half
of width/height of the screen or maximum of width/height of the screen.
In addition, it also allows users to position windows to extreme left,
right, top and bottom of the screen.
Active GNOME windows mean the windows that are currently in use.
